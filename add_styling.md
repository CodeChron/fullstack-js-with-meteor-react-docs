# Add Styling

We are going create our styling from scratch and not use, for example, Bootstrap.  While Bootstrap is great, creating a framework on your own is great for learning purposes.  Additionally, for larger apps, if you started out with Bootstrap, you might find yourself "figthing" or constantly over-riding what Bootstrap did with every new customization.

## Add a css preprocessor.
Add autoprefixing.
