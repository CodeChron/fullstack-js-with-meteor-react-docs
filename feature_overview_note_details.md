# Feature Overview: Note Details

We want to be able to add more note content.  We'll do this by creating a unique page for each note. To do this, we are going to do the following:
- Add note details route - a unique page for each note.
- Add a note title field.  This will be what we'll click on to view note details.
- When we create a note, automatically display the new note (redirect to the note page), so we can add detailed content.
- Update our list to display the note title and have it link to the details page.
- The first thing we need to do is to add a note title field.  While doing this, let's update our data model and data handling to be more suitable for a production grade app.
