#  Make Notes Private

- add accounts-ui
- use same ui as for the logd app, except possibly a simpler version of the options menu


- add a owner id to notes
- update list to only display matches for owner id
- add a login page
- redirect to login page if user is anonymous
- redirect to login page if user accesses a note detail view where their owner id does not match their user id
