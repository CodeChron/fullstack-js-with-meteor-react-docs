# Next: Add Note Details

We want to be able to add more note content.  We'll do this be creating a unique page for each note. To do this, we are going to do the following:
- Add a note title.  This will be what we'll click on to view note details.
- When we create a note, automatically display the new note, so we can add detailed content.
- Update our list to display the note title and have it link to the details page.

Let's start by adding routing and converting our current view into our homepage...
