# Display the note title in the app header (custom layout)
- Update the note header to have a custom 3 column layout.
- Display the note title instead of the app title on the note details view.

# Add Custom CSS
We are going to be implementing some features that will require some custom CSS.  Therefore, instead of using Bootstrap, we'll just roll our own CSS framework.  Since the focus of this course isn't on CSS, you can simply just clone the following repo and check out the following branch to be set up with the custom css.

_These steps are not necessary if you just switch to the custom css branch_

## Install packages

```  meteor add fourseven:scss ```
``` meteor remove standard-minifier-css ```
``` meteor add seba:minifiers-autoprefixer ```
