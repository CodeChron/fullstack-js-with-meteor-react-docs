# Custom App Header

## Update the note header to have a custom 3 column layout

We want our note title to be centered and we'll want a back icon to be left aligned. This will require customizing our app header layout. 


## Use Sass and Autoprefixer
This is not required for what we're doing but it will make writing styles less painful in the long run,


```  meteor add fourseven:scss ```
``` meteor remove standard-minifier-css ```
``` meteor add seba:minifiers-autoprefixer ```
