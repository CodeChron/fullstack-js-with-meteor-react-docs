# Feature Overview: Creating Notes

Next, we are going to start by adding the ability to create notes.  We'll take a data-driven appraoach to this.

First, we'll create a database collection for storing notes.
Then, we'll add a data container that we can use to interface between our database and React components.
Finally we'll add a form component that allows us to create notes.

Let's get started!
