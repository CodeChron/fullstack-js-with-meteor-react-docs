# 04: Create Note (NEW)

_this follows step "3: add app header" in the preview tutorial_

Here we will create a single "Controller" component for managing:
- Creating a note
- Listing existing notes

Add a NotesContainer
**Render NotesContainer as a top-level component (this is new from the preview version, we need to do this because we want to have a top-level container structure to handle component state for the entire page)**

(when we add users, we'll switch this to users container)

Add SingleFieldSubmit to AppLayout and handle create note via props.
