# Display Note Content View Mode

## Exit edit mode and display

These are our general requirements for this feature:

- Allow for clicking on note content to edit it.
- Content auto-saves as you type.
- Click on Done or anywhere outside the content to exit edit mode. (discuss: the done button is just a dummy.)
- Display a message if there is no content. (That also is clickable so you can add content.)
- (Later, we'll add the ability to also exit edit mode by using Shift + Return.)
