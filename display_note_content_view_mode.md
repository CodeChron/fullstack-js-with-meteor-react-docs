# Display Note Content View Mode

We now want to be able to exit the content editor and display our notes in view mode.  Additionally, we want to be able to click on the viewer to return to edit mode.



## Exit edit mode and display

These are our general requirements for this feature:

- Allow for clicking on note content to edit it.
- Content auto-saves as you type.
- Click on Done or anywhere outside the content to exit edit mode. (discuss: the done button is just a dummy.)
- Display a message if there is no content. (That also is clickable so you can add content.)
- (Later, we'll add the ability to also exit edit mode by using Shift + Return.)
