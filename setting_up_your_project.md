# Setting up your project

Create your project directory and cd into it:

```mkdir my_notes_app  && cd my_notes_app```

Add a [ReadMe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) file to your project: 
```echo "# My Notes App" >> README.md```

(Optional, [initialize a git repo](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/).)


## Create the app
Create the Meteor app and cd into it:

```meteor create app``

``` cd app```

## Start the app and get set up for development

- Type ``` meteor ``` to run the app locally.
- Go to http://localhost:3000 to view your app.
- Make sure you have both your client console and your server log visible while working. See [this blog post](http://coderchronicles.org/2016/04/08/getting-started-with-meteor-1-3-react-and-flowrouter/#Start_and_View_Meteor_in_Your_Browser) for a recommended local setup.
- Open up a new terminal tab/window.
- Open up your project in an editor of your choice.
