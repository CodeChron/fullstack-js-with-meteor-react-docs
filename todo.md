# TODO

- Add info to [ReadMe doc](https://github.com/CodeChron/meteor-react-tutorial-notes-app/blob/master/README.md): link to the blog post and tutorial, instructions for how to get the code, a link to the stylesheets only repo.
- Styling updates: go back and apply the corresponding css classes the various elements as they are added
- Update create note to include making it a part of the list component
- Add ReadMe for Stylesheets repo
- **Visualize passing data down through container via route into page**
- List possibly accompanying blog posts.
 - What is JSX actually doing?
 - Integrating Styling into your development process
 - The ES6 Arrow function
 - Keeping functions pure
 - 

## Road Map
- Once this tutorial ships it is considered final.  Any updates will only be to fix errors, bugs, etc.
- List nice-to-haves that we would want to have be part of this app. 
- Create a new repo with this code based and use that as a starting point for a paid version of the tutorial.  Features would include:
- Adding Login/Registration
- Making notes private
- fixed header
- advanced add new components
- advanced options menu component
- exit editor using shift + return
- adding markdown support
- scalable lists (eg with load more)
- deploying the app
- app security
- app refactoring
